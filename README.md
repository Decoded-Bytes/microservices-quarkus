# microservices-quarkus

THIS REPOSITORY IS SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL TO `K8s Native Microservices on Quarkus - 2022 Edition` Course on Udemy


This course is intended for developers who are already familiar with Microservices and wish to implement them on Quarkus.

Equally, Quarkus developers willing to build micro-services can benefit by going through the lectures in this course. The course covers creating new microservices on Quarkus and deploying them to the Kubernetes environment as docker images or pods.

Working through a combination of theoretical concepts and practical code walkthroughs, a developer should follow along and build as we go through the lectures.

This course is designed as a hands-on exercise where the expectation is for you to build along to understand property-based behaviour changes with Quarkus better.

We will take our devlopment further by using Quarkus K8s API to connect and deploy our project to Minikube 

The course is structured so that almost all lectures start with theoretical concepts followed by hands-on development.

A couple of mid-section exercises will firm your understanding of the concepts.
